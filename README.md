# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Customer-Reviews
Sentiment analysis is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to determine the sentiment expressed in textual data. This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from Amazon's Musical Instruments category to classify them as positive or negative. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using techniques such as TF-IDF. Various machine learning models are evaluated, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy through 10-fold cross-validation. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in sentiment classification and provides insights into customer opinions, which can be valuable for businesses in improving product offerings and customer experiences.
